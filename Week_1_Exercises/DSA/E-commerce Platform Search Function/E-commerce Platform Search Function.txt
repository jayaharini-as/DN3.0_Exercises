## 1. Understand Asymptotic Notation

### Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of algorithms. It represents the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space complexity in relation to the size of the input data. This notation helps in analyzing and comparing the performance of algorithms by focusing on how their execution time or memory usage grows as the input size increases.

- **O(1)**: **Constant Time** – The algorithm's running time or space requirement does not change with the size of the input. It remains constant regardless of how large the input becomes.
- **O(log n)**: **Logarithmic Time** – The running time or space grows logarithmically with the input size. This often occurs in algorithms that divide the problem in half each time.
- **O(n)**: **Linear Time** – The running time or space grows linearly with the input size. It implies that if the input size doubles, the running time or space requirement also doubles.
- **O(n log n)**: **Linearithmic Time** – The running time or space grows proportionally to `n log n`. This is common in efficient sorting algorithms.
- **O(n^2)**: **Quadratic Time** – The running time or space grows quadratically with the input size. This implies that the time or space required increases proportionally to the square of the input size.

### Search Operations

1. **Linear Search**:
   - **Best Case**: **O(1)** – The target element is found immediately at the start of the list.
   - **Average Case**: **O(n)** – On average, the search needs to examine half of the elements in the list.
   - **Worst Case**: **O(n)** – The search may need to examine all elements if the target is at the end of the list or not present.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - **Best Case**: **O(1)** – The target element is found immediately at the middle of the list.
   - **Average Case**: **O(log n)** – The search space is halved with each comparison, leading to logarithmic growth in runtime.
   - **Worst Case**: **O(log n)** – The search space is reduced to one element after several iterations, maintaining logarithmic growth.

## 2. Setup

### Product Class

A `Product` class typically includes attributes that allow for efficient searching, such as:
- `productId`: A unique identifier for the product.
- `productName`: The name of the product.
- `category`: The category to which the product belongs.

These attributes are crucial for performing searches and filtering products based on different criteria.

## 3. Implementation

### Linear Search Algorithm

Linear search involves examining each element in the list one by one until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. This method is straightforward but can be inefficient for large datasets.

### Binary Search Algorithm

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the value in the middle of the interval, the search continues in the lower half, otherwise in the upper half. Binary search requires the list to be sorted beforehand.

## 4. Analysis

### Time Complexity Comparison

- **Linear Search**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n). The performance is directly proportional to the number of elements in the list. This means that as the size of the dataset increases, the time taken to search also increases linearly.

- **Binary Search**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(log n). The performance improves significantly with larger datasets due to its logarithmic growth. It is much faster than linear search, but only works on sorted lists.

### Suitability

- **Linear Search**: 
  - Best suited for small or unsorted datasets. It does not require the list to be sorted and is simple to implement. However, its inefficiency becomes apparent with larger datasets.

- **Binary Search**: 
  - Ideal for large, sorted datasets. It provides faster search times compared to linear search due to its logarithmic time complexity. Sorting the list initially requires extra time (O(n log n)), but subsequent searches are much faster.

In the context of an e-commerce platform, where search efficiency is critical due to potentially large product catalogs, binary search is generally more suitable for scenarios where the product list is sorted or can be sorted. Linear search, while simpler, is better for smaller or unsorted datasets.
